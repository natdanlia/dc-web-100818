## Imperative Programming
- Explicitly tell your program every step it needs to execute
- In vanilla JS, find the relevant DOM elements
- Programmatically create, update, or remove DOM elements

## Declarative Programming
- Tells the program 'what' the webpage should be/should look like
- The 'how' is abstracted

## Virtual DOM

## State
- State is similar to props, but it is private and fully managed by the class component (can't be functional)
- Set up the state object using this.state in the constructor
- or outside the constructor

## Conditional Rendering?
- Don't modify state directly, use this.setState({})
  - works asynchronously
- When does the DOM get re-rendered?

## Controlled Forms and Event Callback handlers

## On Your Own
- practice working with other input types (textarea, select, checkbox, radio button)
- https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html
