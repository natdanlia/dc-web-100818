        <p>Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. Just make little strokes like that. I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all.</p>

        <p>That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. Don't be bashful drop me a line. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him.</p>

        <p>It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs.</p>
