## Stylesheets and Selectors

How do we add CSS to our HTML page?
* Inline

Types of CSS selectors
* HTML tags

* Ids

```
HTML Tags:
p {
  font-size: 20px;
}

Class Selector:
.navbar {
  margin-bottom: 0px;
}

ID Selector:
#main-page-title {
  font-family: sans-serif;
}

```


## The Box Model

4 Elements of the box model:
* Content
* Padding
* Border
* Margin

(Use Chrome Web Developer to explore!)

## Layouts & Positioning - Floats & Clear
Floats - take our elements outside of the standard flow of the webpage
```
.grand-canyon-image {
  width: 400px;
  float: left;
}
```
Use clear to make your elements 'clear' any floats and sit inline with the regular flow of the page
```
.park-info {
  clear: both;
}
```
## Layouts & Positioning - CSS Grid

Makes it easy to create well-designed and responsive pages
