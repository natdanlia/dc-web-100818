# Intro To React

## Challenges With Mod 3 Apps
- repeating the same code (document.querySelectAllTheThings)
- Manage the DOM (appendChild every single element)
- folder structure
  - how to organize our code
  - managing dependencies
- The feedback loop was also manual


## Creating a React App
- `create-react-app <app_name>`
- `npm install`

## Node, Node Package Manager, package.json

## Webpack and Modular JS

## JSX and Babel

- sometimes, they do the exact same thing

#### functional
- more succint/less code!!!
- "lighter" requires less dependencies
- dumb

#### class
- allows us to manage state 


## Default exports and imports
